Subject: Helix Assistant (Phase 1) is live — context-aware chat with DB access, screen awareness, knowledge base, and streaming UX

Hi team,

Quick update on the chatbot work. I’ve shipped Helix Assistant — Phase 1, and it’s already usable in the scoped areas below. Here’s what it can do today, what it can’t (yet), and what’s coming next.

What’s in Phase 1 (now live)

Reads real data: Helix can query our database and return answers grounded in live records.

Wired areas (current scope): Home, txnworkdesk → General Details, Document Details, and Finance Details are wired. Other menus within txnworkdesk are intentionally wired as empty placeholders so the AI will respond that those sections are “under development.”

Understands the current screen (when wired): Using hooks from our microfronten packages/common, Helix can detect which screen you’re on and tailor responses. Important: the hooks must be added per screen; if a screen isn’t wired, the AI is blind there.

Updatable knowledge base: Helix uses a curated knowledge base we can keep expanding (FAQ, ownership, “how do I…”, internal glossaries, etc.).

Streaming responses: Messages stream token-by-token for a smoother, faster UI—early signal first, then details—so you’re not staring at a spinner.

Memory & context (local): Chats are saved in Local Storage; you can rename a chat and delete a chat anytime.

What isn’t automatic yet (by design)

Prompts are processed one-by-one. Helix does not automatically “know everything” we could pass to it. We still need a capability adapter to assemble the right context for each kind of request—mapping user intents → data fetches → prompt templates → structured outputs. This sits outside the model and centralizes orchestration and guardrails.

Developer notes (please read)

Wire the hooks on every screen that should be AI-aware. No hooks = no context.

Define minimal data contracts for the capability adapter (inputs/outputs, schemas). This keeps prompts stable and reduces prompt fragility.

Keep the KB clean and versioned. Small, well-scoped articles beat giant dumps.

Guardrails: read-only where appropriate; log tool calls; add rate limits; redact sensitive fields in the adapter layer.

Recently tested prompts (examples)

You can try these now to get a feel for capabilities and current limits:

how many transactions we have right now?

what screen is this?

what is the oldest transactions? (this one is test only where the ai don’t have access to the data asked by user)

how many transaction per year?

can you give me summary data snapshot

show status mix group by year

can you give last 5 pending transaction last 2022?

can you give the details in json format?

Put this 5 in table

can you give percentage value of the transactions per year?

i mean the percentage compare from previous year to the next year so i'll now if its increasing or decreasing

how did you get it? can you show

can you give me summary data snapshot

can you show table for pending and register status per month for year 2020-2021?

export its table

Export all transactions

who is behind tradeexpress?

who should i ask regarding this

who works in tradexpress

who develop tradexpress helix

(Stars indicate variants that request structured output or exports.)

What’s next — Phase 2 (navigation & actions)

Phase 2 will focus on true UI actions: navigating screens, clicking Edit, populating form fields, confirming with the user, clicking Save, typing into fields, and so on. This will extend the capability adapter with safe tool-calling (click, type, select, submit), confirmations, deterministic selectors, stable IDs, transaction safety (dry-runs, previews, undo where possible), and robust audit logging.

I’ll also be exploring OpenAI’s AgentKit—released October 6, 2025—as it could materially improve how Helix’s chat works behind the scenes by standardizing tools, memory/state, evals, and embeddable chat UI components. This aligns well with Phase 2’s goals and may significantly reduce custom glue while tightening permissions and observability.
