Introducing react-components-lib — High-Performance UI Components for React 19
react-components-lib is a modern, enterprise-ready React component library originally developed to support Angular-to-React migration initiatives. While purpose-built for migration scenarios, its architecture is flexible and robust enough for any React project.

Originally implemented as StencilJS web components, the library has been fully refactored into native React components to eliminate performance bottlenecks commonly experienced when integrating web components in React applications.

Now built entirely with React 19 and ViteJS, react-components-lib delivers lightning-fast development workflows, enhanced type safety with TypeScript, and scalable UI primitives tailored for modern React ecosystems — whether you’re migrating legacy systems or building from the ground up.
